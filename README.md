 ## About

 The concept for this exercise is to create our own News App. 
 We have to use an API to get the information from the current news, but we can build it at our own taste, as long as it is dynamic.
The intructions were to make this project in two days, as for the first day we would arrange and hardcode the layout of our app and the second day we would fetch the API information and deploy it to a cloud system.

__Note__: We have built this project as part of a two-day assignment and it's a work in progress.
Additional features may be added.

## Assignment requirements

- Time period: two days.
- Build and deploy a news app.

## Tech

### Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

### Deployment

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Wireframe
This is how we have envisioned [Stacked News](https://github.com/SteveMobs-Salt/stacked-news/blob/master/wireframe%20main%20page.png).

## Approach
1. Plan frontend features with Github project's Kanban board and decide on stack.
2. Create team accounts on Vercel and Github, and connect Github repo to Vercel.
3. Setup boilerplate code for React and Bulma. 
4. Test the Guardian's api and set up mock dataset.
5. Test and implement api endpoints for the core features.
6. Apply styling finishing touches.
7. Final build and deployment on Vercel.

__Possible extra features__: 
- Add a link to the article displayed on the page. 
- Have a Pagination System.
- Have a rotating carousel of the most important news on the front page.
