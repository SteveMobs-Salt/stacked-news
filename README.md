 ## About

Stacked News is the result of a mob programming exercise to create a news app made with an external API that is deployed on the cloud.
Stacked News uses The Guardian's API to fetch the latest news from the publication according to specific search terms and categories. We added pagination to display all results on consecutive pages. We styled our website with the Bulma CSS framework and deployed Stacked News onto Vercel.

__Note__: We have built this project as part of a two-day assignment and it's a work in progress.
Additional features may be added.

## Assignment requirements

- Time period: two days. 
- Build and deploy a news app.

## Tech

### Frontend

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

### Deployment

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Wireframe
This is how we initially envisioned [Stacked News](https://github.com/SteveMobs-Salt/stacked-news/blob/master/wireframe%20main%20page.png).

## Approach
1. Plan frontend features with Github project's Kanban board and decide on stack.
2. Create team accounts on Vercel and Github, and connect Github repo to Vercel.
3. Setup boilerplate code for React and Bulma. 
4. Test the Guardian's api and set up mock dataset.
5. Test and implement api endpoints for the core features.
6. Apply styling finishing touches.
7. Final build and deployment on Vercel.

__Possible extra features__: 
- Add a link to the article displayed on the page. 
- Have a Pagination System.
- Have a rotating carousel of the most important news on the front page.
