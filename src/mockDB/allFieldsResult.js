As their first original story since 2017’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation\">Coco</a>, Onward asks a similar question – and provides a very satisfactory answer. Its setting is a realm of mythical creatures who live much as modern-day humans do – less Middle-earth than 1970s fantasy art come to life. The magic has pretty much gone. The unicorns forage through suburban rubbish bins, and even though he could gallop at 70mph, the centaur cop drives a car – impractical as that may be.</p> <p>Onward indicates early on that it is going to be a quest movie. It even signposts how it is not taking the straightforward route but the “path of peril”. As with the best of Pixar’s output, the journey is as much inward as outward (or onward). Our heroes are two blue-skinned elves: weedy, insecure Ian (voiced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-holland\">Tom Holland</a>) and his slow-witted elder brother Barley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-pratt\">Chris Pratt</a>, channelling Jack Black), whose encyclopedic knowledge of arcane magical lore might just come in handy. Their father died before Ian was born (mum is now dating the centaur cop), but he left the brothers an odd gift to open on Ian’s 16th birthday: a spell to bring him back for a day. As anyone who has seen the trailer will know, the spell only half-works: the bottom half. All the brothers end up with is their father’s feet and legs.

There are surprises and delights along the way: some surreally comical, some modestly spectacular, others that could have been cadged from an old Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.

The brothers’ characters deepen considerably as they discover and reveal strengths and vulnerabilities. Amid the inevitable climactic action, the reunion with the father is resolved in a way that is delicate, unexpected and quietly moving. Rather than offering trite homilies, Onward feels sincere and specific, and all the better for it.

There’s just one problem: Max doesn’t know how to kiss. Lucky for him, his crew – the Beanbag Boys – have his back. Together, aspiring tough guy Thor (Brady Noon) and sweet boy Lucas (Last Man On Earth’s Keith L Williams) try to make sense of this intimidating landmark of adolescence. But researching kissing is harder than they imagined. Googling “porn” proves overwhelming and disappointing. (“They didn’t even kiss!” “Well, not on their mouths.”) So, they steal Max’s dad’s drone to peep on the teen girl nextdoor (Molly Gordon), whose boyfriend has just dropped by. But when she snags this flying spy, the boys will have to bargain to get it back. And so begins a quest that will see them in a 10-speed chase, a Frogger-like race across a highway and a frat-house brawl where a bunch of bros get schooled.</p> <p>The script by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky is packed wall-to-wall with jokes, to the point that this critic missed lines that were drowned out by the roars of laughter from the packed house at the Paramount Theatre. Having written on a string of sitcoms and helmed episodes of The Office, Stupnitsky brings a finely honed skill for punchline pacing to his feature directorial debut. But there’s just one problem. It’s mostly the same jokes over and over: cute kids cursing and not understanding sex stuff. Initially, it’s jolting fun to see these baby-faced boys dropping F-bombs or mistaking a cache of BDSM gear for “weapons” and a sex doll for a CPR dummy. (“It’s sticky.”) But as the boys run screaming through the second act, these bits offer diminishing returns. The foul language becomes a bit numbing.

                        "bodyText": "Imagine Superbad with sixth-graders and you’ve got Good Boys, a raunchy R-rated comedy that’s made its world premiere at this year’s SXSW. Superbad writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg produced the film, which follows three 12-year-olds through a wild journey involving a peeping Tom drone, club drugs trapped in a childproof bottle and nunchucks that are actually anal beads. Jacob Tremblay, who won hearts opposite Brie Larson in Room, stars as girl-crazy Max, who sees an invite to a “kissing party” as the perfect chance to get close to his crush. There’s just one problem: Max doesn’t know how to kiss. Lucky for him, his crew – the Beanbag Boys – have his back. Together, aspiring tough guy Thor (Brady Noon) and sweet boy Lucas (Last Man On Earth’s Keith L Williams) try to make sense of this intimidating landmark of adolescence. But researching kissing is harder than they imagined. Googling “porn” proves overwhelming and disappointing. (“They didn’t even kiss!” “Well, not on their mouths.”) So, they steal Max’s dad’s drone to peep on the teen girl nextdoor (Molly Gordon), whose boyfriend has just dropped by. But when she snags this flying spy, the boys will have to bargain to get it back. And so begins a quest that will see them in a 10-speed chase, a Frogger-like race across a highway and a frat-house brawl where a bunch of bros get schooled. The script by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky is packed wall-to-wall with jokes, to the point that this critic missed lines that were drowned out by the roars of laughter from the packed house at the Paramount Theatre. Having written on a string of sitcoms and helmed episodes of The Office, Stupnitsky brings a finely honed skill for punchline pacing to his feature directorial debut. But there’s just one problem. It’s mostly the same jokes over and over: cute kids cursing and not understanding sex stuff. Initially, it’s jolting fun to see these baby-faced boys dropping F-bombs or mistaking a cache of BDSM gear for “weapons” and a sex doll for a CPR dummy. (“It’s sticky.”) But as the boys run screaming through the second act, these bits offer diminishing returns. The foul language becomes a bit numbing.
