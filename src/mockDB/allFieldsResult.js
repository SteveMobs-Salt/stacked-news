It is so clear that Trump had a different set of opponents in mind and now he’s having trouble changing strategies.”</p> <p>Colbert also mocked the Trump campaign’s “clearly misogynist” attack on Harris as “power-hungry” and “overly ambitious”.</p> <p>“Of course she’s ambitious! She’s running for vice-president! Who does that without ambition?” Colbert said, pointing out that that nobody just “falls into” becoming the “second most powerful person in the world”.</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also dismissed Trump’s attempts to discredit Kamala Harris, starting with the president’s apparent confusion that Biden would choose a running mate who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/27/second-democratic-debate-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">memorably challenged him in the primary debates</a>. “Of all people, Donald Trump should totally understand how you can be with a woman who’s publicly humiliated you,” said Noah over a photo of Trump’s wife Melania.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1293738497199800327\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Kamala Harris is confusing the s**t out of Trump and Fox News. <a href=\"https://t.co/YuwMQW0zAt\">pic.twitter.com/YuwMQW0zAt</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1293738497199800327?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“He also shouldn’t be surprised that past enemies can become your friends,” Noah added, and listed off a number of Republican congressmen who have worked with Trump despite their blistering criticisms: Ted Cruz, who called him a “pathological liar and narcissist”; Lindsey Graham, who once said Trump was a “bigot and nutjob”; and Marco Rubio, who called him “a con artist”.</p> <p>Jokes aside, Noah called Biden’s decision to pick Harris – the first black female or south Asian candidate on a major party ticket, a moderate Democrat who once served as attorney general in California – a “genius move”, because “not only does she tick a bunch of boxes, but clearly, conservatives are going to struggle to put her in one”.</p> <p>Noah played a series of clips from Fox News in which conservative pundits <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/12/politics/republican-attacks-kamala-analysis/index.html\">struggled to demean her</a> – she’s too telegenic, but also too ambitious, they said.

                        "bodyText": "Stephen Colbert A day after the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden selected the California senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, Donald Trump attempted to tear her down – she’s “nasty”, he said in a press conference. “She was extraordinarily nasty, she was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing,” he said, “very, very nasty”. The “nasty” attacks were, as Stephen Colbert pointed out on Wednesday’s Late Show, deeply unoriginal. “How lazy are you?! You’re just repeating what you said about Hillary. You’re stuck in 2016! And that’s not fair – why should you be the only one who gets to live in a time when you’re not president?” The Trump campaign has experimented with calling her “phony Kamala” but is reportedly still “workshopping effective nicknames” to paint her as “ruthless” and “power-hungry”. “What a wonderful use of the commander in chief’s time,” Colbert deadpanned, imagining Trump as a Mean Girls character poring over his “burn book” instead of handling the coronavirus crisis. On a phone call with Fox News, Trump continued to drum up fear over Harris by calling her “the most dangerous choice” because “she’s the most liberal person supposedly in the Senate”. “What is he talking about?” Colbert marveled. “Harris is an establishment Democrat and a former prosecutor. It is so clear that Trump had a different set of opponents in mind and now he’s having trouble changing strategies.” Colbert also mocked the Trump campaign’s “clearly misogynist” attack on Harris as “power-hungry” and “overly ambitious”. “Of course she’s ambitious! She’s running for vice-president! Who does that without ambition?” Colbert said, pointing out that that nobody just “falls into” becoming the “second most powerful person in the world”. Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also dismissed Trump’s attempts to discredit Kamala Harris, starting with the president’s apparent confusion that Biden would choose a running mate who memorably challenged him in the primary debates. “Of all people, Donald Trump should totally understand how you can be with a woman who’s publicly humiliated you,” said Noah over a photo of Trump’s wife Melania. “He also shouldn’t be surprised that past enemies can become your friends,” Noah added, and listed off a number of Republican congressmen who have worked with Trump despite their blistering criticisms: Ted Cruz, who called him a “pathological liar and narcissist”; Lindsey Graham, who once said Trump was a “bigot and nutjob”; and Marco Rubio, who called him “a con artist”. Jokes aside, Noah called Biden’s decision to pick Harris – the first black female or south Asian candidate on a major party ticket, a moderate Democrat who once served as attorney general in California – a “genius move”, because “not only does she tick a bunch of boxes, but clearly, conservatives are going to struggle to put her in one”. Noah played a series of clips from Fox News in which conservative pundits struggled to demean her – she’s too telegenic, but also too ambitious, they said. The pick was surprising, then it was boring. She incarcerated too many people as California’s attorney general, but is too soft on crime. “Poor Republicans, they’re so confused,” Noah mocked. “Honestly, it’s kind of cute watching Republicans flail around trying to figure out the right talking points. It’s like when a litter of puppies is born but they haven’t opened their eyes yet.” Jimmy Fallon And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon recapped Biden’s first appearance with his new running mate at an empty high school gym in Wilmington, Delaware. “That’s right, Biden and Harris shared a stage for the first time since the debates,” Fallon said. “You can tell Biden hasn’t forgotten, because when Harris went in for a handshake, he flinched.” Trump, meanwhile, labeled Harris with the unoriginal “nasty”, which shouldn’t be surprising, said Fallon – “unfortunately for Harris, if you want well wishes from Trump, you’ve gotta be in prison”. In other news, Trump called into Fox News to continue sowing undue fear about mail-in voting, claiming that “people are just going to grab batches of [mail-in ballots], you talk about China and Russia, they’ll be grabbing plenty of ’em”. “Usually when an old man starts accusing people of stealing the mail, it’s time to put grandpa down for his nap,” Fallon joked.",

In her novels, stories and poems she used the songs and ballad traditions of her native country, often writing in Angus dialect. It is for the poignancy and longing for the Angus countryside in her poetry that she is best remembered. Reid's song The Wild Geese was also known as Norland Wind. William Lamb was a Scottish sculptor and artist influenced by his great love of Montrose. Image: Violet Jacob (1863-1946), 1925, William Lamb (1893-1951), © the copyright holder.

He was elected a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1906, and exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal Scottish Academy and Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.

He graduated Edinburgh University, as a surgeon, in 1888, after which he was posted to Hong Kong. While there he played cricket for the Hong Kong cricket team and survived the tragic sinking of the steamship SS Bokhara on 10 October, 1892. He had to have a lung removed but continued to play cricket for Hong Kong and moonlighted occasionally as a writer. Eventually he retired in 1901 and settled in Forfar. He was elected to the town council in 1905 and served for 30 years, being made provost from 1925 to 1931. He became convener of the Public Health Committee and was responsible for many improvements to the public health administration of the town.

He studied at Glasgow School of Art and after a year’s scholarship in Italy, where he was strongly influenced by the Renaissance painters, he returned to live in his native town. He worked very slowly and his paintings bear witness to an immense attention to detail, as this painting of Montrose shows. He was an official war artist during the second world war, suffered chronic asthma and died in 1949, having produced only 39 oil paintings. Image: Montrose from Ferryden, Edward Baird (1904-1949).

                        "bodyText": "When Melbourne’s Yarra Plenty regional libraries first went into lockdown in March, shut the doors and left the remaining unborrowed books on their shelves, staff were sent home with a phone. “One of the hardest things about lockdown was people being separated from their community,” said Lisa Dempster, Yarra Plenty’s executive manager of public participation. “The library is often a hub for the community, and we identified the most vulnerable cohort of our community would be the elderly.” So the library staff pulled from their database the phone number of every library member over the age of 70 – a total of 8,000 records. Then the librarians started calling those members. All of them. “We called them to say hi, see how they were doing, and then see if there was anything they needed help with, such as access to services, counselling support, tech help, that kind of thing. We would then refer them to a service that would help them,” said Dempster. “What we’ve found mostly is that people are really up for the chat and love getting that call from the librarian. Some calls go for five minutes and some go for half an hour or more.” Yarra Plenty’s “caring calls” are just one of the ways that libraries around the state have been servicing community needs since the onset of Covid-19 shutdowns. From fine amnesties, to boosting the prominence of digital offerings, to simply putting books in the post, libraries have drastically changed the way they operate to accommodate the massive social changes imposed by governments during the pandemic, often with heartwarming results. Early in the lockdown period, Monash Libraries supplied reading material to accompany Meals on Wheels deliveries, calling recipients in advance to ascertain their reading tastes. Hobson’s Bay delivered guitars to households thanks to a partnership with a local organisation, Guitars Gathering Dust, which provides schools with reconditioned instruments for music students. Many libraries have transitioned in-person services, such as daily onsite storytime sessions for babies and toddlers, to the online space. Some offer it in languages other than English too, such as Monash, where they pre-record storytime in Mandarin, Italian, Greek and Auslan. Over at Yarra libraries there are streamed author talks in partnership with literary magazine Kill Your Darlings as part of the magazine’s long-running First Book Club. City of Melbourne libraries, meanwhile, have been running renters’ rights and responsibilities workshops, seminars in partnership with the ATO to help people with their tax returns, and online literary salons reading Australian short stories or novel extracts aloud for adults. “Things that we would normally do in person we’ve moved online and tried to respond to what people need,” Justine Hyde, the creative city director at the City of Melbourne told Guardian Australia. Sometimes those needs aren’t literary at all. “We had a social worker in the library to help identify and reach out to people who were spending time in the library who might have been homeless or victims of domestic violence,” Hyde said. “And that social worker while in lockdown has been reaching out to those regulars that we know, to keep them connected with the services they need.” Before the ultra-restrictive stage four measures, which mean even librarians can’t be onsite, many branches were offering book bundle services and curated books parcels for pick-up or delivery. Moreland libraries member Ri Liu told Guardian Australia she rediscovered her local library after the lockdown started. “I was stuck at home, not currently working and feeling pretty low and looking for glimpses of positivity and hope. And I thought maybe the local library has something that can help,” Liu said. “I had really positive memories of going to local libraries as a kid, it was my happy place.” She discovered Moreland local libraries were offering to deliver 10 books to people’s homes, so went through her reading list and reserved some online. A couple of weeks later the books arrived at her door, just before stage four lockdown. “I was feeling pretty low that day and it was a really nice moment,” Liu said. “I see it as an essential service. Because when you’re stuck at home and you’re not able to afford books, it’s really nice to be able to access them for free. It’s one of the few things in the world that you don’t have to pay for.” She was not the only one singing the praises of Moreland’s libraries: one patron told Guardian Australia that they received a book delivered in person pre-stage four from the Brunswick branch accompanied by a handwritten note from the librarian. While physical books are still popular, Dempster and Hyde both said access to the online resources their libraries offer – such as borrowing of audio and e-books, free film streaming services and the like, which are available through most public libraries – had risen dramatically. “I feel like there are a lot of hidden gems in library services that we’ve been able to promote through lockdown,” Dempster said. The phone-banking librarians at Yarra Plenty got through to all of their elderly members during the first lockdown. Now, with Melbourne in its fifth week of lockdown 2.0 and its harshest level yet, they’re moving through the whole list again – making a total of 16,000 calls.

Democrats sought to keep the current amount of $600 a week, while Republicans pushed to cut it to $200. “They’re also proposing turning the food stamp program into actual stamps you lick for sustenance,” Colbert joked.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjJEWK4ZwBM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jjJEWK4ZwBM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Rather than address the gridlock, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/07/donald-trump-covid-19-unemployment-talks\">signed an executive order on Saturday</a> to supposedly provide $400 of supplemental unemployment, extend the payroll tax holiday and impose a moratorium on evictions. “I can understand why he’s in favor of providing that,” said Colbert, “because come January, everyone in his family might need it.”</p> <p>But there’s just one problem with the executive orders: “It’s against the law,” said Colbert. Not only are they unconstitutional, but “they also don’t help”. That $400 in weekly supplemental income? Trump’s order requires states to pick up 25% of the tab, which Colbert compared to saying: “Hey everybody, drinks are on me! As long as you pick up 25% of it first – you people are desperate, you’d hate you if you don’t do the thing I just promised you would.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/07/seth-meyers-trump-fox-news-late-night-recap\">Seth Meyers: Fox News will let Trump 'get away with any lie'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The payroll tax holiday, meanwhile, only delays the taxes until the end of the year; Trump promised to make them permanent as an incentive for re-election in November. “Uh, buddy, that’s a pretty small carrot,” said Colbert, who broke out his Trump impression: “Give me another four years of unbelievable corruption and unbridled destruction of all norms and if you do, free refills on your soft drink of choice with purchase of $10 or more.”</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also discussed Trump’s slapdash series of executive orders, which many have criticized as not only unconstitutional in bypassing Congress, but also untenable. The eviction moratorium, for example, merely advises federal agencies to “consider” whether evictions are necessary. Even Ben Sasse, Republican senator from Nebraska, called Trump’s orders <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/10/unconstitutional-slop-donald-trump-denounces-gop-senator-ben-sasse/3334538001/\">“unconstitutional slop</a><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/10/unconstitutional-slop-donald-trump-denounces-gop-senator-ben-sasse/3334538001/\">”</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1293011051827658753\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trump thinks his unconstitutional executive order on COVID relief should get him a spot on Mount Rushmore smdh <a href=\"https://t.co/Yi2kq1j9TZ\">pic.twitter.com/Yi2kq1j9TZ</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1293011051827658753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 11, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>“Damn, unconstitutional slop? I thought that’s what they called the in-flight meals on Spirit Airlines,” joked Noah. “But you’ve got to give it to Trump, man – he knows that Congress is so gridlocked, they can make even him look good.”</p> <p>“It doesn’t matter if his executive orders are illegal or toothless or completely unworkable,” Noah continued. “He understands that even the appearance of doing something is better than the appearance of going on recess in the middle of a recession.” Which is what <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/coronavirus-relief-bill-senate-recess.html\">Congress is doing for the month of August</a>, although “Congress will tell you that they aren’t on recess. Apparently they’re just ‘at home’, but they’ll come back if there’s a deal, which there won’t be, because they’re not working.”</p> <p>By and large, between process and proposals, “Trump has just created a mess,” said Noah. Freezing the payroll tax, for example, would either hit people with a larger tax bill later or <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/trumps-payroll-tax-cut-would-terminate-social-security-critics-say.html\">drain </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/trumps-payroll-tax-cut-would-terminate-social-security-critics-say.html\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/trumps-payroll-tax-cut-would-terminate-social-security-critics-say.html\">security</a>, which gets its funding from payroll taxes. Trump’s executive orders, Noah concluded, are thus like “those coupons that you get where it says the good news in big letters: ‘free value meal!’ And then on the bottom it says ‘offer only valid in Alaska between two and four in the morning and if Jerry is working, then you have to share your fries with him.’”</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL-1OdkF0nE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mL-1OdkF0nE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on Late Night, Seth Meyers lambasted Trump’s “meaningless, unconstitutional” executive orders, which he signed over the weekend “rather than negotiate with Congress, while tens of millions of Americans face evictions and go without much-needed unemployment benefits”.</p> <p>Meyers dismantled several of the Trump administration’s spins on the measures, such as the payroll tax holiday, which will either hit businesses with a larger tax bill at the end of the year – thus precluding help to actual workers – or defund social security. Asked about the impact on social security as he boarded Air Force One this weekend, Trump claimed the tax holiday “will have zero impact on social security”.</p> <p>“That’s not how this works,” Meyers rebutted. “This isn’t one of your businesses. You can’t just move money around to cover your losses.” Meyers imagined Trump’s money-swapping in action: “I got it! We’ll just move money around from the tax fund to the casino fund to the hotel fund to the slush fund to the porn star fund. Boom, done.’”</p> <p>“Americans can see through this,” Meyers concluded. “He’s desperate and unpopular, which is why he’s signing empty executive orders and <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-postal-service-sabotage-vote-by-mail.html\">sabotaging the post office</a>. He has no accomplishments, no policies,” and, to quote Trump at one of his speeches, “no anything”.</p>",

As long as you pick up 25% of it first – you people are desperate, you’d hate you if you don’t do the thing I just promised you would.” The payroll tax holiday, meanwhile, only delays the taxes until the end of the year; Trump promised to make them permanent as an incentive for re-election in November. “Uh, buddy, that’s a pretty small carrot,” said Colbert, who broke out his Trump impression: “Give me another four years of unbelievable corruption and unbridled destruction of all norms and if you do, free refills on your soft drink of choice with purchase of $10 or more.” Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also discussed Trump’s slapdash series of executive orders, which many have criticized as not only unconstitutional in bypassing Congress, but also untenable. The eviction moratorium, for example, merely advises federal agencies to “consider” whether evictions are necessary. Even Ben Sasse, Republican senator from Nebraska, called Trump’s orders “unconstitutional slop”. “Damn, unconstitutional slop? I thought that’s what they called the in-flight meals on Spirit Airlines,” joked Noah. “But you’ve got to give it to Trump, man – he knows that Congress is so gridlocked, they can make even him look good.” “It doesn’t matter if his executive orders are illegal or toothless or completely unworkable,” Noah continued. “He understands that even the appearance of doing something is better than the appearance of going on recess in the middle of a recession.” Which is what Congress is doing for the month of August, although “Congress will tell you that they aren’t on recess. Apparently they’re just ‘at home’, but they’ll come back if there’s a deal, which there won’t be, because they’re not working.” By and large, between process and proposals, “Trump has just created a mess,” said Noah. Freezing the payroll tax, for example, would either hit people with a larger tax bill later or drain social security, which gets its funding from payroll taxes. Trump’s executive orders, Noah concluded, are thus like “those coupons that you get where it says the good news in big letters: ‘free value meal!’ And then on the bottom it says ‘offer only valid in Alaska between two and four in the morning and if Jerry is working, then you have to share your fries with him.’” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers lambasted Trump’s “meaningless, unconstitutional” executive orders, which he signed over the weekend “rather than negotiate with Congress, while tens of millions of Americans face evictions and go without much-needed unemployment benefits”. Meyers dismantled several of the Trump administration’s spins on the measures, such as the payroll tax holiday, which will either hit businesses with a larger tax bill at the end of the year – thus precluding help to actual workers – or defund social security. Asked about the impact on social security as he boarded Air Force One this weekend, Trump claimed the tax holiday “will have zero impact on social security”. “That’s not how this works,” Meyers rebutted. “This isn’t one of your businesses. You can’t just move money around to cover your losses.” Meyers imagined Trump’s money-swapping in action: “I got it! We’ll just move money around from the tax fund to the casino fund to the hotel fund to the slush fund to the porn star fund. Boom, done.’” “Americans can see through this,” Meyers concluded. “He’s desperate and unpopular, which is why he’s signing empty executive orders and sabotaging the post office. He has no accomplishments, no policies,” and, to quote Trump at one of his speeches, “no anything”.",

Byrne (AKA Patrick) designed the cover of Donovan’s 1971 LP HMS Donovan. The skull jewellery and flayed eagle guitar in National Velvet symbolise Byrne’s disillusionment with the America he discovered. Image: National Velvet, 1975, John Byrne (b 1940) © John Byrne/DACS .

During the court hearing Wilson was also accused of having caused &nbsp;“discord between William Henry and his workers”. In the end he was charged with libel only. Wilson was incarcerated in 1792 and 1793 for another libellous poem and again in 1794 for distribution of radical propaganda. Image: Alexander Wilson (1766–1813), Poet and Ornithologist, J Cairns.

By living with the children of Townhead, Eardley was able to gain a realist understanding of her subjects. Her process of painting was collaborative and the street children were regular visitors to her studio and enjoyed being painted, seeking both entertainment and to entertain the artist herself.

Photograph: Paisley Museum and Art Galleries , 4:C - The ‘Glasgow Boys’, as they called themselves, are recognised as a disparate group of young painters who predominantly worked in Scotland and kept studios in Glasgow. Disillusioned by Scottish academic painting, the ‘Boys’ found inspiration in the art of the Hague and Barbizon schools and in the work of the contemporary French realist artist Jules Bastien-Lepage (1848-1884). In emulation of the Barbizon School, the group worked together in artists’ colonies. Image: Spring, William J Kennedy (1859–1918), Photograph: Paisley Museum and Art Galleries, 5:B - James Elder Christie was born in Fifeshire and moved to Paisley as a young child. He attended Paisley School of Design and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from 1874. His oeuvre often features the work of Robert Burns and he was known as a raconteur of Scottish poetry. Christie maintained links with Paisley and he established the Paisley-Renfrewshire Society in London in about 1878. Image: Tannahill, James Elder Christie (1847–1914). Photograph: Paisley Museum and Art Galleries , 6:A - John Wilson was professor of moral philosophy at the University of Edinburgh from 1820-1851. He was an advocate, literary critic and author. The Scottish sculptor James Fillans (1808-1852) created a portrait bust of Wilson, also part of the Renfrewshire council collection. Image: Professor John Wilson, William Nicholson (1781–1844).

Pasuka was co-founder (with Richie Riley) of Les Ballets Nègres, Britain’s first black dance company, which toured the UK and Europe in the 1940s and 50s.

By 1847, Paton had submitted Christ Bearing His Cross for the competition to decorate the newly built Houses of Parliament. Thread tycoon Sir Peter Coats of J&amp;P Coats purchased the painting and gifted it to Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Image: Oskold and the Elle Maids, 1873–1874, Joseph Noel Paton (1821–1901).

Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions come from Paisley Museum and Art Galleries. Managed by Renfrewshire Leisure, the museum houses one of the largest art collections in Scotland. The emphasis of the collection is on late 19th- and early20th-century Scottish artists. Recent contemporary acquisitions include work by artists John Byrne, Steven Campbell and Anya Gallaccio. The museum is undergoing redevelopment, and is due to reopen in 2022 or 2023. You can see art from Paisley Museum and Art Galleries on Art UK here. Find out more on the museum website.",
